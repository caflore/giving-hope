      <h2>About Giving Hope</h2>
      <p>There are many organizations out there who provide help during the humanitarian crisis with some sort of donations but do not cover all types of donations under one roof. There are users who want to donate multiple things and the user needs to surf through different organizations which are clearly time-consuming, and the users might not end up donating everything he/she wants. Also, there are many users who restrain themselves from donating because they fear that their donations are not going to the right hands or are not donated at all. There are applications like GoFundMe, Kickstarter, and Donorbox where people can donate money to individuals or organizations. Our application is not limited to monetary donations. With our application, our users are also able to donate canned goods, water, and clothes by dropping them off at locations dedicated to shipping the donations to the people in need while also being given the option to have their donations picked up. Our application will also have a feature for users whether they want to donate locally, regionally, or internationally, and will also provide proof of the donations such as short videos or date-time stamped photos.</p>
